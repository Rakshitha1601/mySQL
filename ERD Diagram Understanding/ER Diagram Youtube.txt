Note :Above video give basic understanding onCardinality Notations used primarily
 1 : A customer can have o or many orders.Always consider min and max concept on the both sides of table.
Refer diagram.
2:For an order to exist it should have customer and 1 order can have max 1 customer
3:An order can have min 1 Product or many products
4:A product could be part of 0 or many orders.
Note these assumptions decide the cardinality notations used.

Customers and order have 1 is to many relationship.
Orders and Products have Many to Many relationship.
We can have an Order Item Table which acts as a junction object connecting order and product
 to form many to many relationship.
